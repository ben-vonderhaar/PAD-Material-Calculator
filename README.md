# PAD-Material-Calculator

This is a proof-of-concept project that automatically calculates all needed materials to achieve a particular evolution within the Android/iOS game Puzzle and Dragons.  Late-game monsters have extensive and complicated requirements and with all needed data readily available, the total material cost can be calculated quickly with little additional logic.

Eventually I would like this to be an Android application and am continuing to add features and clean up code, as most of the code in this repository was migrated from a similar project.
